            <h1>Hey, I'm Andre Dalwin.</h1>
            <p> I'm a sophomore Computer Science student in the Ateneo de Manila University and 
            I have an interest in programming and visual arts. My previous experiences includes
            animation, brand management, and video production. Trying out and experimenting in motion graphics
            allowed me to expand my creative process and grow as an enthusiast. Some of my recent projects focuses 
            on logo animations, same-day edits, videography, and computer generated imagery, all of which allows me to hone my skills.
            <br><br>
            I am currently the Internal Affairs head at the SOSE Sanggunian as well as the Assistant Vice President for Documentations in COA-Manila. Additionally, I
            am also a Videos member of the Company of Ateneo Dancers Documentation Team.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I am also a programmer who has skills in Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and Flutter.
