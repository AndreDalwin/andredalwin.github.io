        <h2>Hi, I'm Andre. Dalwin is my second name.</h2>
        <p> I'm a sophomore Computer Science student in the Ateneo de Manila University and 
            I have an interest in programming and visual arts. My previous experiences includes
            animation, brand management, and video production. Trying out and experimenting in motion graphics
            allowed me to expand my creative process and grow as an enthusiast.
            <br><br>
            I am currently the Internal Affairs co-head at the SOSE Sanggunian as well as the Assistant Vice President for Documentations in COA-Manila.
