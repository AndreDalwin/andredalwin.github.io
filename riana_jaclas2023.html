            <h1>Riana Presents Study at JACLaS Expo 2023</h1>
            <p> Last October 6, 2023, Riana Ashley Bautista presented her research to attendees of the JACLaS Expo 2023 held in Yokohama, Japan.
                Her study entitled <b>"The Internal and External Risk Factors Related to E-Cigarette Smoking Initiation Among Selected College Participants in a Higher Education Institution in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines"</b> explores the factors that contribute to the initiations of e-cigarette usage among college students in the Philippines. 
            <br><br>
                Riana's presentation in an international conference was unfortunately not shared by her university, University of Santo Tomas (UST), due to their unusually high standards of only posting those who have placed 1st in a category. Still, Riana is very proud of the opportunity to present the study to panelists and attendees in Yokohama, Japan.

                "<i>the past week as been crazy as hell but i honestly dedicated this huge W to the loml for continuously pushing me to go to japan to present our thesis ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­,</i>" said Riana in a recent post in the social media platform, X. She contributes Andre Dalwin, her boyfriend, as one of the people that pushed her to continue to endeavour to present her study in Japan. "<i>i can't count the times i've thought of backing out and thinking that everything wasn't working out equals to "this isn't meant to be". but it WAS meant to be and the experiences and connections i've made are worth it.</i>"
                <br><br>  
                Riana's stay in Japan lasted 5 days, beginning October 5 to October 10. She was able to explore parts of Yokohama as well as Tokyo. She travelled to Japan with her mother as well as another group from UST who also presented their study in JACLaS 2023.
